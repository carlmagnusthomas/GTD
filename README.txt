Ground Truth Dataset (GTD)

This repository contains the files binary labelled datasets used to identify European summer blocking events. It can be extended for other regions and seasons. The labelling was done from studying geopotential height maps across five days within JJA Europe. The xlsx and csv files show how the labels for each period were assigned. The plots that were used in the labelling task are not included in this release. More detail can be found in Thomas et al. (2021).
